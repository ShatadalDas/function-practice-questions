# Questions

1. Write a function that takes an int and returns the factorial of it. Also, restrict the user not to give a number more than 20.

2. Write a function that takes an int and returns the sum of all the digits of a number. This function should work for both positive and negative numbers

3. Write a function that takes two `int` (n, r) and returns the permutation, <sup>n</sup>P<sub>r</sub>

4. Write a function that takes two `int` (n, r) and returns the combination, <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> 

5. Write a function that takes an `uint`, number of rows, for example
```
// number of rows = 5

*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

6. Write a function that takes an uint32, number of rows, and prints pascalâ€™s triangle for that many number of rows, for example
```
// number of rows = 5

1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```

7. Write a function that takes an array as input and then removes all the duplicates from it and returns the resultant array


8. Write a function that takes int array and int target, and returns index of that target inside the array, if not found then return -1 (implement Linear Search here)


9. Write a function that takes int array and int target, it is sure that the array is sorted in ascending order, return the index of that target inside the array, if not found then return -1 (implement Binary Search here)

10. Write a function that takes int array and returns a sorted array, implement Selection Sort.

11. Write a function that takes int array and returns a sorted array, implement Bubble Sort.

12. Write a function that takes int array and returns a sorted array, implement Insertion Sort.

13. Write a function to merge two sorted arrays, that takes two sorted int arrays and returns one single sorted int array, which will be produced by combining the given two sorted int arrays, like for

```cpp
// the given two sorted arrays
arr1[] = {2, 4, 6, 8}
arr2[] = {1, 3, 5}

// the returned array
result[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
```
